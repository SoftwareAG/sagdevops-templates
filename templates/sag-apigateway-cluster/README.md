# API Gateway cluster

Use this template to provision and maintain API Gateway cluster.

## Requirements and limitations

There should not be any other packages installed on the Integration Server or Microservices Runtime instance where API Gateway is running.

Before using this template, you must provision Terracotta cluster and Internal Data Store cluster by applying:
* [sag-tc-cluster](../sag-tc-cluster/)
* [sag-internaldatastore](../sag-internaldatastore/)

### Supported Software AG releases

* Command Central 10.3 and higher
* API Gateway with Integration Server 10.1 to 10.15
* API Gateway with Microservices Runtime 10.1 to 10.3
> NOTE: This template is not supported for Microservices Runtime version 10.4.

### Supported platforms

All supported Windows and UNIX platforms.

### Supported use cases

* Provisioning a new clustered environment containing Integration Server or Microservices Runtime instances with API Gateway 10.1 and higher
* Installing latest fixes
* Configuration of:
  * License
  * JVM memory
  * Primary, diagnostics, and JMX ports for Integration Server or Microservices Runtime
  * Clustered environment with Integration Server or Microservices Runtime

## Using the template to provisioning a new API Gateway Server instances and configure them in a cluster

For information about applying templates, see [Applying template using Command Central CLI](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/sagdevops-templates/wiki/Using-default-templates#applying-template-using-command-central-cli).

To provision a new Integration Server instance named "apigateway" with API Gateway 10.3, install all latest fixes, and configure the cluster:

```bash
sagcc exec templates composite apply sag-apigateway-cluster nodes=[dev1,dev2] \
  is.instance.type=integrationServer \
  agw.memory.max=512 \ 
  agw.tsa.url="dev1:9010" \
  repo.product=products-10.3 \
  repo.fix=fixes-10.3 \
  --sync-job --wait 360
```

To provision a new Microservices Runtime instance "apigateway" with API Gateway 10.3, install all latest fixes, and configure the cluster using default values:

```bash
sagcc exec templates composite apply sag-apigateway-cluster nodes=node \
  repo.product=products-10.3 \
  repo.fix=fixes-10.3 \
  --sync-job --wait 360
```
