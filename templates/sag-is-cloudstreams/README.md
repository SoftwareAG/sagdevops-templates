## Running as a composite template

> IMPORTANT: Apply this template on an _existing_ Integration Server instance with the same release version as CloudStreams.

1. To import the sag-is-cloudstreams/template.yaml file in Command Central, use one of the methods described in [Importing templates library](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/sagdevops-templates/wiki/Importing-templates-library)
2. To apply the template, follow the instructions in [Applying template using Command Central CLI](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/sagdevops-templates/wiki/Using-default-templates#applying-template-using-command-central-cli)

### Example

To install CloudStreams 10.1 on top of the Integration Server instance with name `default`, in the installation
with alias `dev1`:

```bash
sagcc exec templates composite apply sag-is-cloudstreams nodes=dev1 \
  is.instance.name=default \
  repo.product=products-10.1 \
  repo.fix=fixes-10.1 \
  --sync-job --wait 360
```
