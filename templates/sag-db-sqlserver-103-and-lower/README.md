# Creating webMethods database on Miscrosoft SQL Server

With this template you can create user, database, and webMethods database schemas on a Microsoft SQL Server.

## Requirements

### Supported Software AG releases

* Command Central 10.1 or 10.3
* Database Component Configurator 9.10 to 10.3
* webMethods database schemas for products version 9.8 to 10.3

### Supported platforms

* All supported Windows and UNIX platforms
* All supported versions of Microsoft SQL Server database
* Docker Engine 17.09 or higher

## Running as a standalone Composite Template

To install Database Component Configurator 10.1 on the Command Central node with alias `local`, create a database named `webm` and a database user named `webm` with password `webm`, and create database components for Integration Server 10.1 and My webMethods Server 10.1 with user `sa` and password `MaNaGe123`:

```bash
sagcc exec templates composite apply sag-db-sqlserver-103-and-lower
  db.version=10.1.0.0 repo.product=products-10.1 repo.fix=fixes-10.1 nodes=local
  db.host=sqlserver db.admin.username=sa db.admin.password=MaNaGe123
  db.name=webm db.username=webm db.password=webm
  db.products=[IS,MWS]
  --sync-job --wait 360
```

## Using for local development and testing on Docker platforms

1. Launch the Command Central container from the root folder of the following project:

```bash
docker-compose up -d cc
```

2. Launch the [Miscrosoft SQL Server on Linux for Docker Engine](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server-linux/) container:

```bash
docker-compose -f templates/sag-db-sqlserver-103-and-lower/docker-compose.yml up -d sqlserver
```

3. Provision the `sag-db-sqlserver-103-and-loewr` template and run tests:

```bash
CC_ENV=sqlserver ./provisionw sag-db-sqlserver-103-and-lower
```
If the test is successful, the test ouptut contains `TEST SUCCESSFUL`.

You can now use this database for creating instances of webMethods products (for example, Integration Server and My webMethods Server) with the following database connection properties:

```bash
db.url=jdbc:wm:sqlserver://sqlserver:1433;databaseName=webm
db.username=webm
db.password=webm
db.type=sqlserver
```

The properties are pre-set in the `environments/sqlserver/env.properties` file and you can use them by pointing to the environment name, for example:

```bash
CC_ENV=sqlserver ./provisionw sag-optimize-analysis
```
